# OlympicData

With this dashboard I wish to present different insights and patterns throughout the Olympic history.
The dataset comprises all Summer and Winter Games from 1896 Athens to 2016 Rio de Janeiro. It is collected from Kaggle's Olympic Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/olympic-data).
